                Lapis legit itself is known as a layer cake made from native spices of the country. Like cinnamon, nutmeg, fennel, to cloves. The cake mixture consists of dozens of eggs, butter and flour.
                <br>
                Another name for the legit layer is spekkoek. Spekkoek itself is a Dutch language which means fatty cake which has a thousand layers. This of course refers to the ingredients of making a legit layer filled with fatty eggs and butter.
                <br>
                Usually, the legit layer itself is made of dough arranged in layers. What is commonly found is a legit layer with 18 layers. Due to the difficulty and the long manufacturing time, the legit layer is known as an expensive cake.
                <br>
                What makes many people feel quite confused about determining its origin is the fact that the legit layer was actually created by the Dutch using ingredients made from Indonesia.
                <br>
                But there are also those who say that lapis legit is an original Indonesian-made cake inspired by Dutch cake recipes, but combined and modified using Indonesian spices. The legit layer that we know today has adjusted the taste of the Indonesian tongue.
                <br>
                Another allegation is that the legit layer was made by Indonesians, but it was the Dutch who popularized the legit layer by naming specekek.
                <br>
                <strong>Another story comes from ethnic Chinese in Indonesia.</strong> 
                <br>
                The Chinese say that the legit layer is a cake whose recipe is a legacy from their ancestors when they were colonized by Shopping hundreds of years ago. This is said to be the reason why Chinese citizens up to now always make their own legit layers on Chinese New Year celebrations.
                <br>
                Lapis legit is also a dish that must be on the table so when celebrating Sinchia or Chinese New Year. This wet cake is believed to be a symbol of fortune and success that will arrive in the coming year.
                <br>
                Usually, this sweet-tasting cake is enjoyed when chatting with family and closest friends, while sipping a cup of tea or coffee as a companion.
                <br>
                There are various versions that are still confusing, what do you think about the origin of the cake which was named one of the tastiest national snacks in the world? Which version do you believe?
